 Consider an algorithm that takes as input a positive integer n. If n is even, the algorithm divides it by two, and if n is odd, the algorithm multiplies it by three and adds one. The algorithm repeats this, until n is one. For example, the sequence for n=3 is as follows:
 3→10→5→16→8→4→2→1

 Your task is to simulate the execution of the algorithm for a given value of n.

 Input

 The only input line contains an integer n.

 Output

 Print a line that contains all values of n during the algorithm.

 Constraints
 1≤n≤106
 Example

 Input:
 3

 Output:
 3 10 5 16 8 4 2 1
